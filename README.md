## Technologies
     For this app we will be using flutter as our development platform. This means you will need:

          the instructions to complete the installation. 
          
     2. Android Studio

     4. An Andriod Emulator or Physcial Android Phone
          Android Studio has a built-in emulator, however, if you can not get it to work, you can use the
          Genymotion plugin for Andriod Studio which can be at https://www.genymotion.com/plugins/ . 
          Alternatively you can plug your Android phone into your computer to run the app. This link

     To run the mobile app you will need to install the app on the emulator or your phone. There is a button to 
     launch the app from Android Studio in the upper-lefthand corner.
